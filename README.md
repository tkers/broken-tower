# Broken Tower

Cooperative party game where you rebuild a tower as a team. You have to
reconstruct a tower by placing the broken pieces on top of each other. You
receive a couple of unique pieces to build with, but you don't know which pieces
every one else has. Start with the biggest chunks on the bottom, then smaller
ones toward to top.
